## Build notes

We build the repository files with Python 3.10.
You can optionally choose to prepare a virtual environment.
Dependencies are stored in
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) as usual.

```sh
# Setup virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3.10 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

tbd.
